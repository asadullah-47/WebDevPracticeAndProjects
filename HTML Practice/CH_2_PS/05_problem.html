    <h1>BAbar Azam</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Mohammad Babar Azam (Urdu, Punjabi: محمد بابر اعظم; pronounced [Muhamməd babəɾ azəm]; born 15 October 1994) is a Pakistani international cricketer and the former captain of the Pakistan national cricket team in all three formats of the game. A right-handed top-order batter, he captains Peshawar Zalmi in the Pakistan Super League.[2]

        He is Pakistan's most prolific T20I batter, and scored 122 (59) against South Africa in his maiden T20I century, which is the highest individual score in T20Is by any Pakistani cricketer.[3] He also remains the only captain to take Pakistan to the number 1 ODI team rankings. Azam was a member of the Pakistan team that won the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy.[4][5]
        
        In November 2023, Azam resigned from captaincy in all formats after the 2023 Cricket World Cup.[6] However, in March 2024, he was reappointed as Pakistan's captain in white-ball cricket.[7]
        
        In June 2024, Azam became the most prolific run-scorer of all time in T20 internationals, in a match against the United States in the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup group stage.[8][9][10]
        
        On 1 October 2024, Azam resigned from the white-ball captaincy for a second time, citing his workload and desire to focus on his batting.</p>
        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>Babar Azam was born on 15 October 1994 into a Punjabi Muslim family in the Walled City of Lahore. His older first cousins (through his elder paternal uncle) Kamran and Umar Akmal were the reason he was attracted to cricket, and their stories inspired him to take up cricket as his profession. He had been a ball boy at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaddafi_Stadium" Stadium[11]>Gaddafi_Stadium</a> before joining a cricket academy and starting his domestic cricket career there.

            He sought guidance from Rana Sadiq, his first coach, who taught him the fundamentals of batting. Later, he went on to be a part of the Pakistan U-19 (under 19) setup.</p>
